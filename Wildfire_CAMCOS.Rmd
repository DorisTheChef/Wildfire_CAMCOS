## Introduction 

[To write: Describe the dataset (qualitatively) and our objective. Where do the data come from? What are the researchers trying to answer? Why do they care?]

## Descriptive Statistics

[To write: Describe the dataset quantitatively. What are the observational units and variables. How many observational units (in each area) are there? How many variables. How are the variables grouped and who grouped them?]

```#{r, child='./Graphs/your-figure_file.Rmd'}
# include each graph (including code, output, and description of figure separately)
```

## Background 

[To write: describe the statistical methods we will be using. Will probably include some discussion of logistic regression (or multivariate logistic regression), fixed and random effects modeling, perhaps multivariate statistics]

## Analysis

[To write: Include justification for why we chose the model we'll end up using. Include R code for actually fitting that model. Justification for why model assumptions are appropriate. Formulate conclusions from model (test for significance of effects of interest, for example)]

## Discussion/Results

[To write: discuss implications of findings in the analysis section. Explain what the results mean in context.]

## Future Work
