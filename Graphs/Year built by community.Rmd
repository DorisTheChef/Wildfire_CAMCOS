The age of homes varies widely across communities, reflecting different growth patterns. Tahoe-Donner is dominated by homes built between the 1980s and 2000s (over 85%), making it one of the newer housing areas. Paradise also shows a strong spike in the 2000s (35%) with a secondary rise in the 2020s, suggesting recent rebuilding activity. Feltonâ€™s stock is older, with nearly 75% of homes built before 1980, peaking in the 1970s. Redwood Estates stands out as the oldest community, with over a third of homes built before 1950. Saratoga has a more even mix, with houses spread from the 1940s through the 2000s, reflecting steady development over time.

Overall, this highlights that some communities like Tahoe-Donner and Paradise are largely modern, while others such as Redwood Estates and Felton still have older homes that may face higher wildfire vulnerability without renovation.
