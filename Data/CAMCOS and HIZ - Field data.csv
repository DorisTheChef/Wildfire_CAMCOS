-Replace all vents with 1/8th metal mesh screen (or add mesh on top)
-Dix dryer vent or replace (stuck open & full of lint/fuel)


0-5:
-Prune back branches overhanging the garage. 
-Shrubs under the apple tree need trimming. (Keep 3x the shrub height in space & tree minimum height of 6-10')

Main issues:
Pull debris/litter and other fuels away from areas within 5' from house. Prune back or remove woody vegetation near decks. Remove tree/shrub growing under deck entirely. (The 5' zone should be clear to prevent ember rain from igniting home.)

Remove debris from roof & gutters. Cut back branches within 10' of roof, especially near stove/chimney exhausts. Consider sealing in tile edges with birdstops to prevent debris and ember intrusion between roofing and roof deck.

Replace all vents with 1/8"" metal screens (or add mesh on top of existing vents). Replace plastic dryer vent(?) with metal springed-louver.

For areas under decks and walkways/stairs, consider screening in with 1/8"" mesh, or fully enclosing. 

Address unsealed wood issues (rotten areas will be more vulnerable).

Remove clutter near house sides & under carport/open covered area (especially if those materials are flammable) as they can trap additional debris (e.g. trap windblown leaves, and also embers).

Clear 10' bare ground near propane tank and additional 10' no vegetation beyond that.

Vegetation directly against the structure: Remove debris on roof and in gutters. Remove tree branches overhanging the roof& create 10' separation from structure to nearest branch. Removing branch will eliminate source of debris. 

Seal any weathered wood & repair damaged stucco.

Remove build up of debris and litter that piles against house on uphill side.

Create 10' of bare ground/concrete space and additional 10' of no vegetation around propane tank.

Prune & space vegetation so trees have 10' soace between canopies and ladder fuels are eliminated (the canopy base 6-10' from the ground with 3x the vertical distance of any shrub height below)

Clean out gutters & debris on roof.
Vents: Replace/add 1/8"" metal mesh.
Remove flammable items (woodpile and propane tanks) from under deck/house.

Remove any branches within 10' of house. 
Remove any fuels from 5' of house (incl. dead woody plants, trashcans, woodchips/mulch, clutter. & Only irrigated non-woody vegetation).
Remove dead vegetation (including snags, logs, heavy debris piles, leaves fallen into other vegetation) especially within 30' of house.

-Deck needs sealant/paint.
-Check that all vents are 1/8"" starting with eave/attic vents.
-Add metal non-combustible gutter guards.
-Add reflective address signs to house & at the street.

Yard, starting with 0'-5' area (the 'ember-free' zone):
-Flammable mulches & debris and other clutter should be removed from 5' zone & from decks & at base of fences.
-Trim & prune trees throughout property (small trees near roof, eaves & siding & deck on downslope side.)
-BBQ propane tank needs clearance and keep away from house sides.
-Shade structures/gazebos ideally should be removed >5' from home. Consider retrofitting these structures to non-flammable construction (metal supports & joists) & reduce the canopy to block no more than 10% of area.
-Prevent litter & mulch from accumulating above 3"" in the yard.
-Prune & space trees (>10' between the edges of tree canopies and other trees & house. vertical spacing of at least >3x shrubs/small plants below trees so that tree canopy is 6-10' from ground). Front driveway and lawn side of house look overall good, bottom side could be improved.
-Consider building islands/patches of vegetation & using walkways and lawns as breaks.

What to prioritize (in order):
Clear the 0-5' zone. 
-Prune & Space Plants & trees, keep branches 10' from house sides. 
-Clear out clutter primarily on or under deck. (dead tree - cat perch?)
-Store flammable materials in a shed away from stucture (spray cans, oils etc, garden supplies)
-clear leaf litter (major fuel wick) from around all sides.
-separate Shrubs in front of house (continuous fuel source leading to house).
-Consider sealing in the deck with 1/8"" metal mesh or enclosing entirely.
-remove woodpiles to at >30' away with correct storage.

beyond 5':
-Prune & space trees & shrubs >10' canopy separation, >3x shrub height to avoid ladders
-Remove heavy fuels from yard (many cut logs rounds near house sides) & store correctly as a woodpile (>30' away from structures, fire tarp or enclose, & 10' no organic soils or vegetation).
-thin litter layer to <3""

Start with home: Clear debris off roof & gutters. Remove vegetation and debris directly near home within 5' and especially near deck support beams (consider enclosing or screening off the under-deck area). Install 1/8"" screens in vents. Move propane tank away from the deck to  an area clear of vegetation.

Remove trees overhanging the home, and within 10' of the home/deck (especially near chimneys/stovepipes). Space tree canopies by at least 10' and more in steep slopes. Remove or reduce shrub and small tree ladder fuels under larger trees.

Notes:
Cal Fire did not visit, but Felton Fire person did. They've done 20% of the stuff suggested. Also told to use fire resistant paint.

Consider planting choices within near home to be only low-growing, non-woody, well-watered plants. Make sure to avoid any branches within 10' of house.
Move propane tank away from home, propane tanks will need 10' bare mineral soil (or concrete) with additional 10' radius of no vegetation.
Add a reflective address sign, visible in all street directions.
Zone has few trees & shrubs but where they are makes continuous fuels. Separation in these areas would create fuel break (2x the shrub height, horizontally, and 10' spacing between tree canopies).

Debris on roof is very minor (so it passed), but it accumulates in complex roof pockets which have issues during wildfire (embers also accumulate where leaves do). Consider removing pergola screen roof & avoid roof construction covering more than 10% of pergola.

Consider working with neighbors to space oaks trees and thin dense brush, working to remove ladder fuels tight canopy spacing.
